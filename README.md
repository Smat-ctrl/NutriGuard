# 1. DESCRIPTION

**Name: NutriGuard**

**Product description:**
The idea is a mobile application that has profiles for each unique user where you can add your preferences and your allergies. The app is used to help people receive an alert if a product they have bought or are thinking of buying contains something they are allergic to/or want to avoid. It is also used for giving reminders of when the food you bought will expire. This is used with an API called OpenFoodFacts and possibly an AI API of sorts (to help with expiration date). There will also be an exchange converter to help people calculate food prices when they are in a different country.

  - FILL IN WHEN INSTALLER IS IN PLACE

**Usage Guide:**

When you start our application, you need to log in, we are limited to one email log in for our database which is why we will give you one.
Enter the password and email to log in. Once you are in you will see the inventory screen. This is the place where your food items will show, you can add them with our scanner or manually add them using the search function.
If you press on groups, in the lower part of the phone you will see groups, if you are not in a group you can start one or be added. Here you can also see the group cart with food items.
If you go to profile, you will see your profile. Here you can see your profile picture and your name. You will also be able to see the dietary restrictions and allergies you've added.
