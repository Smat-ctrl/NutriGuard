# 1. DESCRIPTION

**Name: NutriGuard**

**Product description:**
The idea is a mobile application that has profiles for each unique user where you can add your preferences and your allergies. The app is used to help people receive an alert if a product they have bought or are thinking of buying contains something they are allergic to/or want to avoid. It is also used for giving reminders of when the food you bought will expire. This is used with an API called OpenFoodFacts and possibly an AI API of sorts (to help with expiration date). There will also be an exchange converter to help people calculate food prices when they are in a different country.
